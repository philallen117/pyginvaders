Set up vscode to use the tools defined in the project README.md (pyrefly, black, flake8, pytest).

Also, define a simple copilot-instructions.md file in the .github folder for use on a Python project with Claude Sonnet.

Also, configure flake8 in this project to allow the same line length as black formatter does: 88 characters. Search for any other conventions used by black that conflict with flake8 defaults and configure flake8 to accept them.
