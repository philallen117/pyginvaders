Time to incorporate shields into the game.

Shields display as rectangles with dimensions and color as specified in src/pyginvaders/config.py.
Shields do not move.
Initially in the game state, there is a row of shields spaced out as specified by config.

First, construct a shield class, initialize game state and incorporate drawing shields into the game.

Invader bullets interact with shields. This also affects how shields are displayed.

- Shields are created with a `health` of SHIELD_INITIAL_HEALTH.
- When an invader bullet collides with a shield, the bullet becomes inactive, and the health of the shield is reduced by one.
- If the health is thus reduced to zero, the shield is destroyed and no longer interferes with invader bullets.
- The health of tbe bullet is represented on the screen with the alpha value of the filled rectangle; the alpha is `shield.health / SHIELD_INITIAL_HEALTH`.

Plan these changes.

Running the game, I see bullets seeming to disappear where there is no shield. The shield must be too translucent for humans. I suggest reducing the alpha by 20 with each hit of damage. Add a config parameter, and make the change so that I ran run the game and see how it looks.
