Now, we need a new scene displayed if the player loses the game.

First, just factor out the current drawing logic into a new method of Game.

---

Now, create Game.draw_game_lost. Assuming for example, score is 170, it should show text as follows:
Game over
Score: 170

The text should be centred in the screen and use the size and color found in config.py.

---

Now, update the game loop. If game_lost is true, just draw_game_lost() and stop updating the game objects in subsequent frames. Hint: perhaps test whether game_lost at head of game loop.
