Now it is time for Invaders.

Invaders's width, height and color etc. are controlled by configuration constants, which have already been added to src/pyginvaders/config.py.

Each invader also has an instance variable called `alive`, which is initially `true`. Only `alive` Invaders are displayed and participate further in the game.

Create a class to represent an Invader with a draw method.

When the game starts, there is a grid of Invaders on the screen of dimensions INVADER_ROWS by INVADER_COLS, with layout described by INVADER_START_X, INVADER_START_Y, INVADER_SPACING_X, INVADER_SPACING_Y.

Extend the code setting up the game's state to include this grid and to the game loop for drawing invaders.

--- CUT HERE because context full

Now for invader movement. Invaders move all together. They move horizontally every INVADER_MOVE_DELAY frames, by INVADER_SPEED_X pixels. Initially their `direction` (part of the game state) is positive, that is to the right.

When any Invader that is `alive` reaches the edge of the screen

- The entire set of Invaders drops down the screen by INVADER_DROP_DISTANCE
- Their collective `direction` swaps sign, that is toggles between left and right.

Add support for Invader movement to the code.
