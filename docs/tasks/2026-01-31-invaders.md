Now it is time for Invaders.

Invaders's width, height and color etc. are controlled by configuration constants, which have already been added to src/pyginvaders/config.py.

Each invader also has an instance variable called `alive`, which is initially `true`. Only `alive` Invaders are displayed and participate further in the game.

Create a class to represent an Invader with a draw method.

When the game starts, there is a grid of Invaders on the screen of dimensions INVADER_ROWS by INVADER_COLS, with layout described by INVADER_START_X, INVADER_START_Y, INVADER_SPACING_X, INVADER_SPACING_Y.

Extend the code setting up the game's state to include this grid and to the game loop for drawing invaders.

Now for invader movement. See src/pyginvaders/game.py and src/pyginvaders/invader.py plus their respective tests.

Invaders that are still `alive` move all together. They move horizontally every INVADER_MOVE_DELAY frames, by INVADER_SPEED_X pixels all in the same `direction`. Initially their `direction` (part of the game state) is positive, that is to the right.

Implement this aspect of invader movement.

I want to do a refactoring to simplify future behaviour. Currently, we check in several places whether invader is `alive`. Instead of that, we will simply remove an invader from game.invaders when it is killed.

Plan this change.

There is one more movement behavior to implement.

When any Invader reaches the edge of the screen

- The entire set of Invaders drops down the screen by INVADER_DROP_DISTANCE
- Their collective `direction` swaps sign, that is toggles between left and right.

Add support for this movement to the code.

There is a problem in the way the horizontal and vertical movement of the invaders interacts. I observe that the invaders drop diagonally as they near the edge of the screen. I want them to reach the edge and then drop vertically. Find this bug and plan a fix.
