This folder contains task descriptions for working with Claude Sonnet via GitHub Copilot.

The file naming convention is `yyyy-mm-dd-descriptive-string.md`.

Tasks should be broken into stages that are each simple enough to for the agent to tackle as a single turn. It is OK to assume that earlier parts of the task are still in the model's context window.

When referring to file, use paths relative to the project root, without a leading slash.
