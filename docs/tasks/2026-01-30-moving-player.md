So far, the game simply comprises a welcome message.

I want to remove the welcome message and display the single Player object.

- Player displays as a blue rectangle 50 wide by 30 high.
- Player is initially centred width-wise and 60 from the bottom of the game window.
- The Player moves left when the user presses the left arrow key, and similarly for the right arrow key.
- If Player crosses the edge of the game window, the game brings the Player back to the edge of the game window.
